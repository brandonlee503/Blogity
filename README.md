# CS-290-Final-Project
# Blogity

This is my first website and final project for Web Development.  It's a basic blog website with user registration capabilities that attempts to utilize a bit of everything we've learned in the class.  I will be updating, but feel free to play around with it!

Front end uses technologies from bootstrap and jQuery to make pretty.  Database stuff is done with PHP and mySQL.
